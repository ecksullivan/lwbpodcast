It's also really well documented, and it's really just a joy to build with. The docs are filled with humor and it makes learning Statamic fun! Compared to a lot of the other CMSes out there, none of them have such a well designed user interface on the back end. It's quick, responsive, easy to use, and it makes creating and managing my sites content a cinch. It's also full of little easter eggs that make the experience so much more enjoyable, like the is_numberwang modifier in the Antlers templating language, or the little power up sound that plays when you update Statamic. 

The templating language that Statamic uses, Antlers, is super intuitive and allows you to bring your own HTML markup and create anything you can imagine. Statamic really works around you, you don't have to work around it. Statamic also includes the most important features out of the box, like forms, image manipulation tools, and a bunch of other cool stuff. If there's a really specific feature you need that's not built in, they also have a huge marketplace to buy third-party plugins to help you achieve whatever it is that you need to do. The fact that they include so much stuff out of the box, there's no need to fill your site with an excessive amount of plug ins *cough* wordpress *cough*",Statamic is definitely developer oriented. It assumes you know how to build websites and have experience doing that.,""

The preview mode kicks ass and the focal point feature might seem small but it is huge. If I calculate the TCO of Statamic it is close to free comparing to WordPress, Wix and others.",There is no database but I can't notice it as a user. This is by far the best CMS software I have ever used and I have used CMS software since 1995.,The amount of addons and themes to buy as new user is very limited.,""
02/20/2020,Capterra,Statamic,Peter Olson,Strategic Director,Pattern,"Insurance, 11-50 employees",6-12 months,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,9/10,Great software for quickly creating content sites ,Its been great.   We are using it at my company and I found it simple enough that I rolled out a personal blog as well (by myself).,"I'm a huge fan of its simplicity.  I used Drupal for years, wordpress, and octobercms and while they may have their place, for a website that is primary content, statistic makes is very very easy.   

It makes it easy to build out wordpress gutenberg-esk content pages without all the overhead and slowness of wordpress.  The user experience is great for content people who really don't know anything about ""websites/it"" but are marketing & content people.

The ability to customize the front end is far simpler than many many cms's out there.

I also love that we don't need a database.  We were able to reduce monthly costs by quite a bit on hosting this thing over something like drupal.","Its small still.  Finding developers that are specialized in it was kind of a pain. That said, in v3 its a laravel package which opens it up to a larger pool of developers.",""

The sleekness of the system enabled me to build a very efficient and sleek website.,"Very sleek interface and the ability to customize a lot of stuff. Full control over frontend. That it is based on Laravel, which is my primary framework.","Some functionality is not easily customisable. I am looking forward to v3, which works as a package on top of Laravel and will likely solve all this.",""

It's a complete package for 90% of the websites I develop. With v3 on the horizon that percentage will go up to a 100. The interface is gorgeous and delivers a great editing experience for my customers. I develop faster and have a lot more fun doing it. This results in better bespoke websites and happier customers. ,The current version has a few omissions which will be rectified in the free v3 update.,""
02/07/2020,Capterra,Statamic,Ben Furfie,Web Development Manager,IMImobile PLC,"Telecommunications, 1001-5000 employees",2+ years,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,10/10,Perfect replacement for WordPress in an enterprise environment,"We moved to Statamic after the recent changes to WordPress' direction made it clear it was longer suitable for enterprise websites, like ours.

As a development team embedded in the group marketing and communication teams, we are dealing with 10+ websites that receive a lot of content changes. The content often falls out of sync between the development sites and the live site. This can result in a lot of headaches when it comes to bringing the new changes into the sites when they are approved for deployment. When we were using WordPress, because of its blog-focused database structure, any changes made often had to be replicated manually.

By switching to flat file content management, this issue was eradicated. Before changes are deployed, the latest content is brought into the development branches. Content and new changes are all deployed at the same time through zero-downtime deployment.

Feedback from both the development and content teams has been exceptional.","- Built on Laravel, giving us access to the Laravel ecosystem of packages and tools.
- Flat file nature of the software makes it easier to backup and secure our enterprise websites.
- Use of flat file storage also makes our development teams' workflows easier and more robust.
- Use of flat file storage also makes deployment and maintenance much easier.
- Compared to WordPress, Statamic makes it easy to enforce brand guidelines, while giving our content, corporate, and marketing teams flexibility to build new pages using semantic structures.
- Ability to choose between flat file and database driven content gives us maximum flexibility in terms of how to structure the sites we build and maintain.
- Coming from WordPress, it's a breath of fresh air to have a single team to communicate with for any bugs and feature requests. They are also extremely responsive.
- Clear separation of front and back end data and logic means we can ask our front end team to work on this without needing to consult the back end team, and vice versa.
- Antlers template language is well liked by our front end team.",That we didn't switch to using it sooner.,""

It gives me the power/function I need out of the box, but is still really configurable and customizable if I ever need to build in more powerful functionality. Since it is a Laravel app at the core, it makes it a breeze to work with.","- Flexibility and a ""bring your own markup"" mindset
- Security
- Admin UX/UI is a huge plus for clients since it is so simple to use
- Version control everything if you want
- Incredible support and community ","Everyone certainly has lots of opinions when it comes to CMS choices, and people should use what they're comfortable developing in. 

Maybe that's a con, Statamic is better suited for developers to use",""

It is flexible, fast, powerful, and has a robust community and toolset for modern web developers.","Statamic 2 has some admin panel performance issues when you add thousands of pieces of content to a section.  On the front-end/rendering side it is plenty fast, but most of these issues are being addressed with the Statamic 3 beta which is already an improvement of an already-great piece of software.",""
